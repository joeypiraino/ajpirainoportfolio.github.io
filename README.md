# Joey Piraino : Web Development Student

Deployed Link: https://joeypiraino.github.io/portfolio/

This is the creation of my Portfolio site as a future Developer.

The site contains the barebones beginning design of the Home/About Me page, the Portfolio Works page, and the Contact page.

The layout of the site was created with Bootstrap elements.

The view had to be consistent between desktop and mobile browsers.
